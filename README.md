# **BikeMobility: Incentivizing Active Transportation**

Welcome to the BikeMobility repository, a comprehensive system designed to incentivize bike usage through a user-friendly mobile application that rewards users for engaging in regular biking activities.

## **Project Description**

This project aims to develop a system that provides rewards based on the distance and frequency of biking trips. It accurately tracks a user's path, provides statistics for each journey, and implements measures to prevent fraudulent practices.

The application not only tracks and verifies rides but also collects invaluable data for further analysis. It offers personalized analytics, allowing users to review their ride history, evaluate their performance on individual trips, and gain insights into their biking habits.

In order to promote continuous use, the system incorporates various reward mechanisms inspired by gamification strategies, including scoring systems, sweepstakes, and other engaging solutions. It also features a robust backend infrastructure for data collection and management.

The anticipated outcome of this project is a feature-rich mobile application that is accompanied by a backend system for data management. Users benefit from personalized analytics and gain insights into their biking habits. In addition, the system is equipped to manage incentives and prizes, leveraging the potential of gamification to foster greater user engagement.
